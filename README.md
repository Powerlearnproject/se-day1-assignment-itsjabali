#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  - Definition: Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

  - Importance in the Technology Industry: Software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life as well as offering solutions to human problems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  - The development of programming languages: this allowed humans to interact with computers without directly using binary.
  - The establishment of software engineering as a discipline: this was the establishment of specific frameworks, guidelines and best practices for any software devlopment endeavours.
  - The rise of agile methodologies: occuring in the 2000s, these methodologies allow developers to incrementally integrate user feedback into the product.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirement determination: involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: writing of the nesseacry code and building the software in accordance with the design specifications.
  - Testing: conducting of tests to ensure built software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: the release of the final product (software) to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: the provision of continuous support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  -  The waterfall methodology is a step by step approach with distinct phase flowing downwards like a waterfall (scenario example: building a banking system) while Agile methodologies are iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change(scenario example: building a game).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software developer: writes code and implements software solutions.
  - Quality assurance engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project manager: oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  - Integrated Development Environments, for example Visual Studio Cude, provide vital tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.
  - Version Control Systems, eg Git, are needed to track changes to source code and coordinate work among team members.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Challenge: Keeping up with the fast pace of technological change can be overwhelming.
Strategies:
Continuous Learning: Regularly attend workshops, webinars, and courses to stay updated.
Networking: Join professional groups and forums to exchange knowledge and stay informed about the latest trends.

- Challenge: Project requirements can change frequently, causing stress and confusion.
Strategies:
Agile Methodologies: Implement agile practices to adapt to changes quickly.
Clear Communication: Maintain open lines of communication with stakeholders to manage expectations and clarify requirements.

- Challenge: Tight deadlines can lead to rushed work and lower quality.
Strategies:
Prioritisation: Use project management tools to prioritise tasks and manage time effectively.
Realistic Planning: Set achievable deadlines and break tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Tests individual components to catch bugs early.
- Integration Testing: Ensures different components work together correctly.
- System Testing: Verifies the complete application meets requirements.
- Acceptance Testing: Validates the software in real-world scenarios before deployment.
* Each type of testing is crucial for ensuring software quality and reliability.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting precise and effective prompts to guide AI models in generating desired outputs. Itâ€™s crucial because well-designed prompts can significantly enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI responses, making interactions more productive and reliable.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague prompt: Describe a city.
- Improved Prompt: You are a photograpgher who has travelled widely. Describe in 3-5 lines a bustling, modern city at night, with skyscrapers illuminated by neon lights and busy streets filled with people and vehicles.
- The improved prompt is more effective because it accurate response and vivid.
